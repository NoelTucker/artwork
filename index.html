    <h1>Noel Tucker's Artwork</h1>
    <p>Greetings, my name is Noel. This is a catalog of some of my artwork from throughout high school. I've taken multiple visual art classes, in which I have explored many media, from watercolor, to charcoal, to ceramics, to print-making, honing my artistic abilities. I've also taken filmmaking classes, in which I have created multiple short movies.</p>
